You can expect to see four problems on the exam, roughly distributed according to the following topics. 

### 1. Modeling for Process Control

* Review lecture notes for Feb. 15, 20, 22
* Review textbook section 2.3 on Degree of Freedom analysis
* Do Example Problems 2.2, 2.3
* Reveiw textbook section 2.4 on example models.  
* Do end-of-chapter problems 2.6, and 2.7
* Do Problem 2.16 ... be sure you can write out the equations with the given parameters, and write a function that `odeint` could integrate.


### 2. PID Control Strategies

* Review lecture notes for Feb 27, 29, March 1, 6
* Review textbook sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and Table 8.1
* You should be able to 
  * write the PID algorithm as a mathematical formula, and describe the function of all terms, in either standard or parallel formulations.
  * identify three conditions necessary for bumpless transfer.
  * describe reset-windup, and identify strategy for anti-reset windup.
* Review textbook 

### 3. Linear Programming
