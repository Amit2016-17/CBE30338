    "# Getting Started with Pyomo\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) is a state-of-the-art language for solving optimization problems embedded within Python. Using Pyomo, a user can describe optimization model by specifying decision **variables**, **constraints**, and an optimization **objective**. Pyomo includes features to enable modeling, specifying a solver, and displaying the solution."

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided you have previously installed the Anaconda package, the following commands should successfully install Pyomo, and the glpk, ipopt, and COIN-OR cbc solvers.  These commands should be executed in a command window on either a Mac or PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge pyomo\n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge pyomo.extras\n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge glpk\n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge ipopt\n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge coincbc\n",
    "\n",
    "This installation provides a capable open-source optimization suite with multiple solvers. The solvers are\n",
    "\n",
    "* [glpk](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLPK). \"GNU Linear Programming Kit\" is a software package written in highly portable C for the solution of mixed integer linear programming and related problems.\n",
    "* [ipopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPOPT). \"Interior Point Optimizer\" for large scale nonlinear optimization of continuous systems. \n",
    "* [cbc](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc). \"COIN-OR Branch and Cut\" is a mixed integer linear programming solver written in C++. It generally solves the same problems as glpk, but can run multiple threads, and is usually faster and more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "This collection of solvers is well suited a wide range of process applications. This suite can be further augmented by installing additional solvers from open-source and commercial sources."
