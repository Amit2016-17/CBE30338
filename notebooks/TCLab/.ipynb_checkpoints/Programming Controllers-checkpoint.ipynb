    "Controllers are a unique bit of software. Like a typical function used in scientific/engineering programming, a control algorithm processes data to produce a numerical result. But unlike typical scientific programming, a controller:\n",

    "* create many instances of itself with different parameter values for large-scale applications,\n",
    "* may operate asynchronously.\n",

    "Fortunately, modern programming languages provide features well suited to these requirements. In Python, for example, we might consider implementing controllers\n",

    "* as generators\n",
